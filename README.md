# 2048-Board-Game
The software created aims to create a version of the game for smartphones: "2048". The game consists of moving, joining and creating various tiles within a grid composed of tiles, the value of these consists of powers of two and the player can move all the boxes according to the direction chosen. If two squares with the same value collide as they move in the same direction, they join in a single box that will have as value the sum of the two tiles and the respective color. The game is won when, continuing to add the tiles, you can create one with the value 2048. If the player can no longer move the squares, because there are no empty spaces or there are no adjacent tiles with the same value, the game ends by recording a score equal to the sum of all the unions between the tiles. The user can choose, in addition to the classic game mode, a variant with various multipliers, namely bonuses that will help him achieve victory or malus that will increase the difficulty of the game, and another mode that allows the use of three other different grid sizes.
